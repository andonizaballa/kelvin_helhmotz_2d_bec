# Repository Name

## Description

This repository investigates the various physical mechanisms that underlie the dynamical instability of a quantized vortex array at the interface between two counter-propagating superflows in a two-dimensional Boseâ€“Einstein condensate. Instabilities of markedly different nature are found to dominate in different flow velocity regimes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the code.

## Usage

This is a private repository, so, I am the only one that contributes into it.
